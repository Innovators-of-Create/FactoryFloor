Create: Factory Floor is a Create-centric 1.21.1 modpack with numerous Create and Farmers' Delight add-ons mostly aimed at SMPs.

### Create

Create and its countless add-ons are at the core of this modpack. These add all sorts of tech related blocks, items, and other features that let you automate almost everything in the game.

### Farmers' Delight

Another core part of this modpack is Farmers' Delight as well as several of its add-ons which add various different kinds of foods and food-related blocks and items. Ever wanted to eat chicken nuggets or churros in minecraft? Well, now you can. lol

### Storage

The modpack also adds several mods that make managing your storage a breeze. This includes mods like Functional Storage, Sophisticated Storage, Sophisticated Backpacks, and more.

### Eye Candy

We didn't skimp on eye candy either. The modpack includes multiple decoration mods related to Create and Farmers' Delight so that you can design the factory of your dreams without being limited by the block selection. We have also added several shader packs and resource packs which you can easily toggle in-game for making the game look even prettier. One such resource pack is Fresh Animations which completely overhauls all the vanilla mob animations to look more dynamic.

### Multiplayer

There are also many multiplayer/roleplaying related mods making this pack ideal for servers whether just for a small friend group or a popular public SMP. These mods include Create Numismatics which improves server economics by adding custom currency items, Simple Voice Chat which adds proximity voice chat, and more.

### Performance

Although this modpack is not small or lightweight by any means (as you can imagine by the mod count), it is as optimized as possible considering the amount of features included. There are multiple performance mods included for optimizing various parts of the game without sacrificing on existing features, all of which should have 100% vanilla parity.

So what are you waiting for? Jump into the game and go build a factory!
